# GraphswithMaths
Graphs with Maths is a quick analytics tool for the Math.random() method in Java.
It creates a graph (i hope not many points and lines are out of the drawing box) which shows the range and the differences between each points.
It's not commented, neither beautiful, but it is fun and there will be some new features in the future :)
